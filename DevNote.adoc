cd /global/home/groups/scs/tin/singularity-repo
singularity pull --name satoolbag.sif docker://ghcr.io/tin6150/satoolbag:rocky8
singularity shell       satoolbag.sif
singularity exec        satoolbag.sif  /bin/elinks   http://ipmi-n0175

oh maybe didn't need this, could have pork barrelled on top of:

singularity pull --name tin6150_perf_tools_latest.sif docker://ghcr.io/tin6150/perf_tools:master



TBD:
stuff from 
https://github.com/tin6150/phylotool/blob/tool/install_phylo_tool.sh


there was a pork barrelling... beast?  r4eta?  with things like iperf3

tftpd?

perf_tools
https://github.com/tin6150/perf_tools

that was when singularity and docker build the tools manually.

this repo leverage github workflow cloud build :)


maybe have branch for rocky ve ubuntu


~~~

##// maybe forgot about perf_tools when started this.
##// the two are not the same, but lots of overlap
##// performance benchmarking need lots of tools to check for things... maybe should just merge into 1...  
##// for now, satoolbag is Rocky 8 based, whereas perf_tools is CentOS 7 and Rocky 9
